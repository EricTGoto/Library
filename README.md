# Library

Library is a project using Javascript OOP knowledge to create a web application where users can store book information that will be displayed on cards. Users can add books in to the "library" by filling out a form with information on a book and once the form is submitted, the book is displayed on the web page. 

OOP principles that I have used:
- Factory Function pattern
- Composition

Features:
- random book adding with the OpenLibrary API

To do/ideas: 
- responsive on smaller screens
    - min card size, max card size.. mobile?
- repsonsive on big screens
- sort cards based on attributes
    - ascending/descending by author, title
    - by read status
    - page count?
- local storage
- add tabs to differentiate between read books and unread books
- add read/unread in add book modal
