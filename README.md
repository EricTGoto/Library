# Library

Library is a project using Javascript OOP knowledge to create a simple web application where users can store book information that will be displayed on cards. Users can add books in to the "library" by filling out a form with information on a book and once the form is submitted, the book is displayed on the web page. 

To do:
- implement adding of books by user
- delete single books

Nice to have: 
- random book adding? like wikipedia API to get a random book
- delete all books
